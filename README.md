# Caesar and ROT13 Text Encryption and Decryption Web App

This web app allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using two popular cipher techniques: **Caesar Cipher** and **ROT13**. Users can also generate a decryption key for securely storing and accessing encrypted messages.

## Features

- **Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption**: 
  - Encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique, where a text is shifted by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
  - The shift value can be customized by the user for encryption, and the app calculates the necessary shift for decryption.
  
- **ROT13 Encryption/Decryption**: 
  - A simpler encryption method, which shifts letters by 13 positions in the alphabet, providing a straightforward way of obfuscating text.
  
- **Decryption Key**:
  - Each encrypted message is assigned a unique decryption key, allowing users to later retrieve the original message by entering the key.
